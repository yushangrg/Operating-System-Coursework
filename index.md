# Project Overview

This technical journal documents my coursework for the Operating Systems (CMPN202) module. The aim of this project is to configure, secure, monitor, and evaluate a Linux-based server operating system using command-line tools only.

The coursework follows a 7-week structured approach, covering system planning, security hardening, performance testing, monitoring, and final security auditing. All system administration tasks are performed remotely via SSH, reflecting industry-standard professional practice.

This journal demonstrates:

- Progressive learning across all coursework phases
- Practical Linux system administration skills
- Security configuration and threat mitigation
- Performance analysis and optimisation
- Critical reflection on operating system design trade-offs

# System Architecture Summary

The coursework uses a dual-system architecture:

- Server System: Headless Linux server configured and administered remotely
- Workstation System: Client machine used for SSH access, monitoring, and administration

All configurations, security controls, scripts, and tests are documented weekly with command-line evidence and explanations.
